Source code for [samat.org](http://samat.org/) landing page.

Run `fab build` to generate an output directory; `fab deploy` will upload it to my Web hosting.

Mostly static files (living in src), though some files (Jade templates, JavaScript, CSS, etc) are compiled and placed into output, which is designed to be deployed as-is.

Not decided licensing yetâ€¦
